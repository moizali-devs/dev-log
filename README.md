# ðŸ““ dev-log

> **Tracking my progress across technologies, one commit at a time.**  
> A personal full-stack development log documenting my daily coding practice in **frontend** and **backend**.

## ðŸ“… How This Repo Works
- Each folder is named by **date** (`YYYY-MM-DD`) to record that dayâ€™s work.
- Inside each folder are **all files created that day** frontend and backend together.
- Commit messages summarize what was learned or built on that day.

**Example Structure:**
```
dev-log
